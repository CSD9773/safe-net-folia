#
# Passphrase:
# - Info: It is recommended to change this once in a while.
#         The longer it is, the better, but do not choose too long passphrase, otherwise, it will take long for slower
#         connections to join.
#         Recommended length: 1000. Generate a new one using "/sn generate".
passphrase: ""
# Disconnect message sent to the player if:
# - Info: "\n" can be used for a new line.
disconnect:
  # A not whitelisted IP was used to join the server:
  whitelist: "&7[&6SecuredNetwork&7] &cPlease connect with IP: yourserver.com!"
  # An error occurred while setting the passphrase into the connection, or it is not set (length of 0):
  passphrase-error: "&7[&6SecuredNetwork&7] &cAn error occurred while processing your request.\n\n&7&oPlease try again later. If the problem persists, contact server administrators."
# Enable the plugin's own logging system:
# - Info: Plugin's log files are saved into "logs" folder in it's plugin folder. It is recommended to have it disabled
#         if you are not encountering any problems and/or errors.
log: false
# Enable metrics - anonymous data sending including but not limited to country in which is the server hosted, number of
# cores, amount of players online. These statistics are used to determine the usage of the plugin.
# - Note: When changed, to take effect server restart is needed.
metrics: true
# IP whitelisting:
# - Note: This is NOT any kind of security feature, just a "decoration".
ip-whitelist:
  # Enable:
  enabled: false
  # Whitelisted IPs - these should be the proxy IPs / DNS names (these are just examples, please, delete them if you
  # want to use this feature):
  # - Info: Port must be specified after each IP separated by colon (IP:port). If the connecting player used any of
  #         these IPs, their connection will be allowed.
  #         If your server has dynamic IP, use the "{ip}" placeholder as the server's IP. Please configure the
  #         ip-website field, too.
  #         Please note that your DNS server also accepts YoUrSERVER.com (or similarly formatted) requests. By default,
  #         exactly the specified IPs / DNS names are compared. If you want to allow also these, case-randomly formatted
  #         DNS addresses, including hostnames..., please surround that whitelisted IP by brackets []. Example:
  #         [test.yourserver.com] will allow also TeSt.YOuRserVER.cOm. In case of any questions, visit the wiki, please.
  #         For better readability, you can put spaces (" ") anywhere you want. These will be removed after the plugin
  #         processes the whitelisted IPs. Example: "a . b . c . yourserver . com".
  # - Note: The only accepted IPs are IPv4 formatted addresses.
  ips: [ ]
  # Website used to obtain the value of the "{ip}" placeholder (the IP of your server):
  # - Info: This should be a website that returns only your IP on the GET request (if you open it on your browser).
  # - Note: The Author of the plugin is not responsible for any privacy information and/or data leaks. Pick a server
  #         carefully.

# Update checker:

  # - Info: Recommended having this enabled, so you are always informed about new updates carrying for example
  #         important security patches. THE UPDATER WILL NOT NOTIFY YOU IF NO UPDATE IS AVAILABLE.

  # If a new passphrase is being generated (/sn generate <length>):
  generate: "&7[&6SecuredNetwork&7] New passphrase has been generated and set into the configuration file. Please, use &6/sn reload &7to apply the new passphrase now."
  # If plugin configuration is being reloaded (/sn reload):

    # If the connection logger attached:
    # - Placeholders: {name} - the name to which the logger attached
    attached: "&7[&6SecuredNetwork&7] Connection logger attached to &6{name}&7. The logger will detach automatically detach after the specified player joins, or do that manually via &6/sn connection-logger detach&7."
