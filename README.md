# 🔒 SecuredNetwork
SecuredNetwork is a lightweight plugin protecting you from IP-forwarding bypass exploit, for those who cannot access or configure their firewall systems. The plugin has been serving protection for everyone since 2019, connecting [BungeeGuard](https://github.com/lucko/BungeeGuard) (from which it took the insipation) and the good old IP-whitelisting feature.

# ❓ What is IP-forwarding bypass?
When using a proxy server (e.g. BungeeCord) to connect your servers together, the backend servers must run on offline mode, disabling account authentication. That enables hackers to join backend servers with your account freely.

# 👍 Why to use SecuredNetwork over other plugins?
You can't go wrong with classic [BungeeGuard](https://github.com/lucko/BungeeGuard), however, if you would also like to use the IP-whitelist, this is the way to go. The plugin also supports [GeyserMC](https://github.com/GeyserMC/Geyser) (including [Floodgate](https://github.com/GeyserMC/Floodgate/)), which other plugins do not and includes it's own logging system, in case you would like to keep track of players 😀
